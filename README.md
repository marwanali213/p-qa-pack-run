# p-qa-pack-run

## Overview

I ran the package. But there is a timeout issue after using a local document that needs to be resolved.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install paper-qa
```

## Setup

1. **Install a Custom LLM Locally**  
   Ensure that a local LLM is installed and properly configured to process queries.

2. **Resolve Timeout Issues**  
   There is a known timeout error when attaching a paper. Further debugging and optimizations may be needed.

3. **Implement Paper Retrieval API**  
   The system requires an API to search and retrieve relevant research papers. This functionality must be integrated to improve document searching and retrieval.

## Future Improvements

- Fix the timeout issue when attaching papers.
- Integrate an API for paper searching and retrieval.
